# cs50-Credit_Card_Validator

This is a pretty neat and simple Program in C that takes the Card Number as an input and checks whether the Card entered is Valid or Not.
For the cards like MasterCard, American-Express And Visa, the output will be 'This is a valid American Express Card' if the Card is American-Express 
and the  Numbers are entered properly and so on.
For Cards other than those which are mentioned above, it only shows the validity of the card i.e is it Valid Or Invalid.
The Program uses Luhn's Algorithm to check the validity of the card.
